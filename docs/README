A work on AFL by guiding fuzzer with function relevance.

To Compile AFL:

```
cd /path/to/afl
make; cd llvm_mode/; make
```

To Compile the test subject:
```
CC=/path/to/afl/afl-clang-fast ./configure; make
python util/FInfo.py FInfo.txt FInfo-pre.txt
```
To run afl:
```
/path/to/afl/afl-fuzz -i /input/dir/ -o /output/dir/ -F FInfo-pre.txt -I 0 -- /subject/executable @@
```
To compile SIR benchmark programs with argument fuzzing, add:
```
#include "/path/to/afl/experimental/argv_fuzzing/argv-fuzz-inl.h"
```
to the file containig main(), add :
```
	AFL_INIT_SIR();
```
near the very beginning of main().

Then, compile with afl-clang-fast, preprocess FInfo.txt with FInfo.py,
run afl:
```
/path/to/afl/afl-fuzz -i /input/dir/ -o /output/dir/ -F FInfo-pre.txt -I 0 ./subject/executable
```

```
